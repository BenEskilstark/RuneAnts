- - - - - - - FIX - - - - - - - -
  - alert pheromone inconsistent (and probably shouldn't be rendered)
    - not disappearing after death
  - follow pheromone just gives up after dragging a bit
  - food pheromone not always going away either


- - - - - POLISH - - - - -
  - Score based on food, enemies killed?
    - render score in UI/Game
  - Add music from Antocracy
  - make base look like an ant hill
  - remove un-needed images
  - favicon


- - - - - - PLAY TESTING - - - - - - -
  - collecting food:
    - may recruit too readily to dead trails
    - stop spawning food when there's too many ants
    - ants carrying food shouldn't be able to fight
  - have ants go towards enemy colony too
  - need some sort of overwhelm mechanic to help close out when
    one player controls most of the map
    - what to do during gridlock stage?
    - could just allow more damage to go through
    - perhaps ants somehow "push" their way through?
  - explosive
    - tune score for getting it


- - - - - - RUNE INTEGRATION - - - - -
  - Score
    - how to make score fit linear pattern?
    - can score go down? how to handle win/loss (10x multiplier for win)?
  - get rid of all localStore/api call stuff
  - Rune script include
  - Rune api calls
  - Remove main menu
  - make sure everything is below 25MB
  - Logo: 600x600 png
  - game over
    - call Rune.gameOver(), how to indicate win vs loss?
    - winning gives big score boost?


- - - - GAME MECHANICS - - - - -
  - AI gets explosives?
  - Spider, beetle, scorpion instead of plain food, at least after a bit
  - Enemies spawn faster but you're stronger?
  - Briefly control a scorpion or something?
  - Balance towards losing eventually?
  - Dead ants


- - - - - - REFACTOR - - - - - -
  - pheromoneWorker appears to not update after reset in level editor
  - allow switching between level editor modes and mouse mode
  - clean up config
  - Use UI components package
  - Use utils components package
