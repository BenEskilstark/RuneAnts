- - - - - - - FIX - - - - - - - -
  - alert pheromone inconsistent (and probably shouldn't be rendered)
    - not disappearing after death
  - follow pheromone just gives up after dragging a bit
  - food pheromone not always going away either


- - - - - POLISH - - - - -
  - mobile support:
    - get running on heroku to test true mobile
  - Score based on food, enemies killed?
    - render score in UI/Game
    - win condition
    - hotkey for opening level editor
  - UX
    - Ticker to tell player to tap/drag to add pheromone trails
  - Add music from Antocracy
  - make base look like an ant hill
  - remove un-needed images
  - favicon + name


- - - - - - PLAY TESTING - - - - - - -
  - collecting food:
    - may recruit too readily to dead trails
  - have ants go towards enemy colony too
  - need some sort of overwhelm mechanic to help close out when
    one player controls most of the map


- - - - - - RUNE INTEGRATION - - - - -
  - Rune script include
  - Rune api calls
  - Remove main menu
  - game over
    - add HP to colony and kill it


- - - - GAME MECHANICS - - - - -
  - Spider, beetle, scorpion instead of plain food, at least after a bit
  - Enemies spawn faster but you're stronger?
  - Briefly control a scorpion or something?
  - Balance towards losing eventually?
  - Dead ants


- - - - - - REFACTOR - - - - - -
  - pheromoneWorker appears to not update after reset in level editor
  - allow switching between level editor modes and mouse mode
  - clean up config
  - Use UI components package
  - Use utils components package
